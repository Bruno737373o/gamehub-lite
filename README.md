# GameHub Lite

## What is GameHub Lite?

GameHub Lite is a community-maintained modified version of GameHub for education purposes.

**Note:** This version may display visual inconsistencies and lacks some features (for example “News” and “Free Games” sections) while the community-funded server is being worked on.

---

## Why this release?

- The previous release (v4) became non-functional because the cloud workers it relied upon were taken offline due to privacy concerns.
- The community is working on a more stable and permanent infrastructure.
- Meanwhile, this version (v5.0.0) bridges the gap: most core functionality is restored so you can keep using your library without waiting.

Expect this repository to be updated soon with a more permanent solution, included a patch file that you can apply to your existing GameHub installation.
